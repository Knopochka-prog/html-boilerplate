        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
        <p>Galaktoboureko is a traditional Greek dessert featuring a custard in a crispy phyllo pastry shell. 
            My mom got this recipe from a coworker and made it regularly when I was young. 
            After all these years, it's still a family favorite.</p>
        <p>I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as we do.</p>

        <h2><ins>Steps</ins></h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk 1 cup sugar, semolina, cornstarch, 
                and salt together in a medium bowl until no cornstarch clumps remain.</li>
            <li>Bring milk to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
                Gradually stir in semolina mixture with a wooden spoon. 
                Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. 
                Remove from the heat and keep warm.</li>    
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed. 
                Add 1/2 cup sugar and beat for a full 10 minutes until thick and pale. Stir in vanilla.</li>   
            <li>Fold mixture into the hot semolina mixture. 
                Partially cover the pan and set aside to cool. 
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>     
            <li>Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Place one phyllo sheet into the pan and brush with melted butter;
                repeat with six more sheets.</li>  
            <li>Pour custard into the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining phyllo sheets, one at a time, brushing each with butter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is crisp and custard filling has set, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the custard is just about finished baking, 
                stir remaining 1 cup sugar and water together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil.</li> 
            <li>Remove custard from the oven and spoon hot syrup over top, particularly around the edges.</li>
            <li>Let cool to room temperature, then cut into 16 squares and serve.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
